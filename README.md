# LandonHotelApp

## Motivation
I was motivated to create this project to gain hands-on experience building a full-stack application with both a Java Spring Boot backend and an Angular frontend. The project allowed me to explore multithreading, localization and internationalization, currency handling,and time zone conversions, all within a real-world scenario of hotel scheduling.

Additionally, I wanted to learn how to containerize an application using Docker and prepare it for deployment in cloud environments. This project serves as a portfolio-ready demonstration of my ability to design, develop, and deploy full-stack applications while applying best practices in software engineering.
